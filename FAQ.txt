Q:
How do I set this up?

A:
o Make sure you have CONFIG SCREENWITDH OFF
o Make sure you have CONFIG PROMPT REMOVE VERBOSE
o Make sure you have CONFIG PROMPT ALL
o After importing the mudlet package into a new profile in mudlet, go to scripts->system->misc->variables.
o Adjust the values of the first two tables to reflect your character and your skills.
o Make sure you set your weapon, mount, and the can and toggles variables!
o Make sure you have GMCP enabled.
o All set! System will track everything else through GMCP!


Q:
My prompt isn't showing! Help!

A:
o Make sure you enabled GMCP! See below for how to do this.


Q:
How do I enable GMCP?

A:
o You will need to download one of the RC2.0 files found here: http://forums.mudlet.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1874
o Install the update you have downloaded.
o Open mudlet like normal.
o In mudlet, go to settings, and click 'Enable GMCP' in the general tab.
o Reconnect to the game.

--NOTE! GMCP enabled has a compatability issue with Midkemia's html tags. You can CONFIG MXP ON to cause html tags to be sent as mxp tags instead and avoid this issue. If you don't, any output between < and > will always be gagged, and the client won't receive it.


Q:
I installed the mudlet update above, but now I can't launch mudlet! It's telling me this: error launching the application couldnt find MSVCR100.dll

A:
o This is an error in some versions of windows, not with mudlet, mudlet update, or the system.
o To fix this, go here: http://dllinfo.dll-free-download.org/engine/rss.php
o Use CTRL+F to search for your error message.
o Click the link there to download the missing .dll file.
o Mudlet should now open fine for you!


Q:
How do I update to a newer version of the system?

A:
o Whenever you import the system, it should save all the settings into three files, one each in triggers, aliases, and scripts.
o The easiest way to update is to import the new mpackage, and then delete the three old files.
o Make sure any alises, triggers, or anything else you want to keep across updates is saved outside of those three files!
o If you delete the wrong folder, or need to re-import the same one for whatever reason, you may need to remove the old package in the package manager.
o To remove an old package, click the Package Editor along the top of the main mudlet window.
o Click the package to remove.
o Click uninstall.
o You can now re-import the same package.


Q:
I imported it like you said, but it seems to have only imported the aliases. What's up?

A:
o Sometimes this happens, not sure what causes it. To fix it, you can import the individual .xml files.
o Before you do this, try exiting mudlet and opening it again, sometimes the other sections just don't show up at first. If they're still missing, continue on.
o Go to where you saved the folder from the link on the forum.
o Right click on the system.mpackage file.
o Click extract. This should create three .xml files in the place of the old .mpackage one.
o You can now import the missing settings, which should be the scripts.xml and the triggers.xml.


Q: What's with my prompt?

A:
This system replaces the standard prompt with one that I feel is more helpful. The new prompt looks like this:

100%h, 340e, 0g, 83x xb-pl A:50% - [zorn] H:0 E:0

o Health, by percentage.
o Endurance, standard numeric.
o Magic, by percentage, or faith/guile in standard numeric.
o Experience percentage toward your next level.
o Essentials (equilibrium, balance, riding, and spellshield/off-hand balance if they apply). These are replaced with a - if you do not have them.
o Status indicators, immediately following your essentials. This will display characters for sleep, unconsciousness, prone, stun, and entanglement.
o Adrenaline percentage.
o Current target in square brackets. If bashing, this is your bashing target. If not, this is your PvP target.
o The old target health indicators have been replaced with colorized percentage ranges.
o Change in vital stats. This will display health and endurance, as well as magic/faith if it applies.


Q:
How do I see a list of commands?

A:
o There's a halp alias that displays a list of all the commands available to your current class. Use it!
o Your attack aliases are listed under your class' folder in the skills folder under aliases.


Q:
What's with all the weird colors?

A:
o I'm not so smart, so I read really super slow.
o I replaced a lot of the text seen in combat with much much shorter text.
o The colors help me to keep up.
o If you do not like them, you can add -- to lines with 'cecho' and the ones with 'deleteLine()' in them in the scripts.


Q:
How do I make it bash?

A:
o Enter your bashing area. The system should automatically load targets for that area.
o The system should display the possible targets. If not, your area is not loaded into it.
o The alias aa will start running the bashing script.
o The alias ff will toggle fasthunt on or off. With fasthunt on, changing rooms will cause the system to check WHO HERE and start bashing if you are alone.
o The alias gg will gather coins and any items that may be dropped in the area you're in.
o The alias tgg will toggle gathering of coins when they drop.
o The alias ast will stop running the bashing script.
o You can toggle your ability to use various class skills in the list of can variables under scripts->system->misc->variables.
o The toggles for using class skills are listed under aliases->system->toggles.


Q:
It's not bashing! Help!

A:
o If the system is not sending IH when you use aa, make sure your prompt is properly replaced.
o If your prompt is right, but it's still not sending IH, check that your prompt reflects that you have balance, and are not stunned, unconscious, or writhing. If one of these is wrong, use the rst alias and try again.
o If the system sends IH, but then doesn't hit, or tries to hit something repeatedly that isn't there, make sure the area you're in is loaded into the area list table!
o If none of this fixes your problem, and rst doesn't either, contact me with your class and any information about the issue and I'll try to fix it for you.


Q:
How do I add new bashing areas?

A:
o Go to scripts->system->bashing->area list.
o Look at the table there.
o Insert a new line in the table with the information for your area.
o Let me know so I can add that line to future updates!


Q:
Why won't fasthunt mode work?

A:
o Fasthunt mode will only work if you are bashing alone.
o It will always check that you are alone in a room before hitting.
o This is on purpose and I will not change it in future update, because I do not want people to turn fasthunt on, follow someone else, and walk away.


Q:
How do I make it fish?

A:
o The alias cbait <type> will load the bait you wish to use. Like, cbait minnow.
o The alias dr <direction> will load the direction you wish to fish in. Like, dr n.
o The alias fdis <medium|long> will set the distance to cast at.
o The alias fsh will toggle fishing on and off.
o If you find a bug or problem, let me know! I don't fish, so I don't encounter most fishing errors, and don't know to fix them.


Q:
It won't let me sleep! What do I do?

A:
o The alias ss will toggle standing on and off.
o You must use this if you wish to sit, sleep, or otherwise remain prone.


Q:
How do I make it keep up defenses?

A:
o The alias kd <defense> will toggle keeping up specific defenses. Like, kd insomnia.
o You can also use the ldd <table> alias to load defense options tables.
o You can create your own defense option tables in scripts->system->defenses->options.


Q:
How do I make it queue my attacks?

A:
o Attack aliases are listed under aliases->system->skills, with a folder for each class.
o Use the attack alias for the skill you wish to use.
o If you have balance and are able to attack (not prone, stunned, entangled, etc), the system should use your attack.
o If you are not able to attack, you should get a message saying you queued that attack.
o You may only queue one attack in advance.
o Attack queuing will only work if killing is toggled on.
o The alias tkil will toggle killing on and off.
o The attack aliases will try to hit your targ variable, which is your PvP target.
o You can set targ with the t <target> alias. Like, t zorn.


Q:
Can I make the attack queuing work with keybinding?

A:
o Just copy the value of the alias you want into your keybinding.
o It will work exactly the same! Will send attack if able, or queue it if not.


Q:
Does this thing have a mapper of some sort?

A:
o Sort of, the system stores a map database that you can search, but it doesn't generate a map or speedwalk yet.
o You can use the aliases: area list, room find <string>, room list, room list <area>
o Any numbers displayed in the lists are numbers you can use to PATH FIND to places.
o You will need to type msave after logging in the first time, then it should work bug free-ish...hopefully.
**NOTE** People who have another mapper, or don't want this feature, can disable the mapper folders in aliases, scripts, and triggers under the utility ones in each.


Q:
What other toggles and commands do I need to know?

A:
o The alias hl will toggle healing on and off. Healing off will make the system send nothing but bashing and fishing commands.
o The alias mnt will mount your mount, as defined in scripts->system->misc->variables, under the my. table.
o The alias dm will dismount.
o The alias folm will attempt to lead your set mount.
o The alias cfs will send credits for sale, and will automatically try to buy any credits under 6000 copper.
o The system will continue learning from players or tutors to begin learning from. Leave the room to cancel a learning session.
o Make sure to let me know of any bugs or problems you find! I can't fix what I don't know about!
