o Fixed a typo with chill, it should track it better. -the Wraith
o Fixed some errors in some priest defense lines.

o Added many missing soldier attack echoes.
o I had assume you cannot defend while entangle, seems I was wrong, and have remove this check from system.
o Added channel parsing. You can now use alias, ctells, otells, gtells, gntells, sctells. Stores last 20 tells to that channel. Alias sctells will work for CURRENT society. May need check society list to set current society. -Ethon
o Added and fixed some lines that was missing or wrong, just small cleaning up.

o Fixed some bugs with contort, it should now work properly. Sorry, didn't know the skill, so couldn't test until someone told me it was broke! -Rosalia
o Added and fixed a few random telegraph, hit, miss, and defend lines to improve dynamic defense tracking.

o Added vampire skill, feed, as an entanglement. -Ugralitan
o Added an equilibrium queue in addition to the balance one. Sorry about liturgy! -Veda

v3.3
o Fixed the lust rejection! It actually works now! -Shlean
o Fixed a small typo with the echo for when someone misses you. -Dysse
o Fixed a typo with glorious word, it should track and use it properly now.
o Fixed the gathering toggle in the looting function, you can properly stop picking up coins now. -Firengaud
o Added some magician defenses. -Nivek, Firengaud
o Added stormfury checks to the magician bashing function. It will now use lance instead of spikes if you have stormfury up, even if the temperature is right, unless you have low magic. With low magic and stormfury, it will use ice spikes if possible, and stormfury release if not. -Nivek, Firengaud, Ethon
o Fixed a bug with continuing to cast melting ice spikes, it should stop doing that now. -Nivek
o Added a fleeing queue, it will now turn bashing and fasthunting off automatically when you FLEE, as well as send MAP the next time you change rooms after sending it. -Sutao

o Fixed a major bug that disabled most of the system for priests...sorry about that! -Aodh
o Fixed a bug with holy fire not working in the priest bashing function...hopefully? -Sappho
o Incorporated some of Savil's anti-theft updates, and some other nifty things inspired by it. Thanks! -Savil
 **NOTE** I did NOT include Savil's retaliate function because I feel this is pushing too close to making bashing a bit too automated. Feel free to cannibalize it from Savil's update, but I'm not going to add it to the public version.
o You now have a closing toggle, tcl, to toggle keeping your container closed or not.
o Added a marching toggle. If marching is on and you're a soldier, sending directions will now MARCH instead of just go.
o Added some more magician defenses. -Tethys, Savil
o Finally fixed that stupid shield rune bug. I changed the way the system tracks defending completely, it should now track times more accurately as well.
o Fixed a typo and missing line with sun allergy. -spiders
o Cleaned up and fine tuned soldier defending. A LOT. If you lose to me now it's your own fault and nothing else! Specifically, the system should track telegraph times against dual wielding much more accurately now, and shouldn't get confused about multiple shatters, as well as a few other fixes.
o Changed the can_ variables to a can table. This is so you can save them across updates in the future.
o The system now saves you settings across updates and sessions. The my, can, and toggles tables are saved every time you qq now and loaded from your hard drive on starting up the system's mudlet profile. I also moved them out to their own script, instead of sharing the variables one.
o Fixed the bug that caused the load times script to show bugged the first time you loaded the system on your computer. It now checks if you have the tables saved before trying to load them.
o Updated the halp alias to reflect the new changes and additions.
o Fixed a conflict with priest aliases. Firecall consumption and divine censure had the same name. Firecall consumption is now fcn instead of cns. -Arica
o Finally fixed the q alias. You can now manually load temporary target lists. For instance, in the Greenheart, using q boar deer rabbit and then turning hunting on and walking around will kill only the boars, deers, and rabbits, until you SURVEY or leave the area.
o The system will now display colored percentages for health and endurance when you ASSESS someone.
o The system will now display colored echoes of a target's afflictions when you ASSESS them, as well as echo some useful information based on what it sees. -spiders
o Added an automated nighthawk killer. -Orsyn
o Added a new toggle, you can now switch between percents and numbers in your prompt (for magic and health). -Orsyn
o Added some basic weapon tracking. If you have a weapon with a standard weapon type in the short_desc, the system will now set my.weapon to that weapon type when you're disarmed, etc. -Ignorance
 **NOTE** This won't work for things other than weapons, and obviously is a little bit sketchy. I might take another look at it later and clean it up some.

v3.4.1
o Finished changing the priest tert defend lines. Whoops.

v3.5
o Fixed a major bug that um...sort of disabled the entire system. Oopsie!
o The diag and assess function should now show burn levels instead of simple that the burns are there. -Sappho

v3.6
o Added blood to the prompt for vampires (hopefully).
o Fixed a bug with removing items. -Vanko
o Added bloodlore aliases. -spiders
o Set the stupid class tracking back to how I had it that worked. Grr.
o Added some warning echoes for instant kills that could land on you. Still limited, due to my laziness. -Vanko

v4.0
o Fixed a bug in the vampire blood tracking that was messing up the prompt for most people. -spiders
o Added anachronize as a magician defense, and added a toggle for it in the basher. -Vader
o Fixed the CFS trigger to work with the do_pack alias.
o The magician bashing function will now use ice spikes if you have stormfury up and low magic, instead of releasing stormfury or continuing to use high-cost stormlances. -Firengaud
o The system may or may not work in timewarp now. Honestly no idea. I imported and tweaked the setup I have working in Lusternia, and it works there, so it should work here in theory. I'm sure there will be lots of bugs, so test away.
o The system has a semi-mapper now. That is, it won't walk anywhere, but it does record information on every new room you enter, and store it on your computer. You can now use: area list, room find <string>, room list, room list <area>, and any numbers displayed in the lists you can use to PATH FIND to places. You will need to type msave after logging in the first time, then it should work bug free-ish...hopefully.
**NOTE** People who have another mapper, or don't want this feature, can disable the mapper folders in aliases, scripts, and triggers under the utility ones in each.
o I made toggles capitalize the first letter! Yay!
o Fixed a small bug with mutilate, and another with blacken. -Zona
o Toggling sundering on for soldiers should now work...but it's a waste of time, I'm telling you! -Akaxi
o Magicians can now toggle immolating on to immolate bashing targets with 25% health or less, if they are ignited. -Mardosi
**NOTE** People updating from previous versions may need to add immolate and anachronize to the can table, and immolating and anachronizing to the toggles table, since the system stores your settings on your computer and may not automatically add them.
o Updated the FAQ with some new common questions and instructions for some new features.
o Changed it so the vital stat changes on the prompt only show if they're not 0. Let me know if popular demand wants this changed back.

v4.1
o Fixed a bug in the set_send function that caused the system not to send anything, ever.
o Fixed a bug in the magician bashing that caused it to stop working completely under certain circumstances. -Firengaud

v4.2
o Added the new soldier attacks and afflictions. -Sutao
o Made supernova give aurawarp.
o Sort of fixed the slowcuring bug. It's spammy since it still echoes what it's not sending, but it only actually sends one thing at a time now. Will fix this with next big update. -Firengaud
o If priest class tracking doesn't work now, I give up. So it better work.
o Added Firengaud's magician aliases. -Firenguad

v5.0
o Completely rewrote all the functions. ALL of them. The system has all the same features, but is now neater, cleaner, hopefully faster, and definitely easier to change and update. Sorry to people who were just puzzling out the script! At least it will be easier to learn new version.
o The system is now structured differently, broken into easier to modify modules separated by folders.
o With all the rewrites come new features, including a priority list which you can tweak to personalize the system. Almost all actions now fall in this queue, which dictates the order the system will try to do things. This is most important in slowcuring (timewarp/divine censure) Big thanks to Vanko for writing the default priority list.
o A side effect of this is that slowcuring is now much less spammy, though may not be quite perfect yet.
o Added balance timers. The system will now display the balance time, in seconds up to 1/1000, of each balance you regain. This also allows the system to reset balances that exceed their cap values.
o Tweaked some of the coloring to better suit the new layout of the system. The colors now relate to the different modules.
o You can now toggle fullprompt on and off, doing so will switch between the old method of display a 0 for vitals changes and the new method of only displaying if there is a non-0 change. -Auston
o Read through and updated the FAQ with all the new stuff and new paths to things, as well as adding explanations for some new features and recent bugs people have asked about. -Ged
o Made the auto turnin function easier to find and modify.
o Changed a lot of triggers to faster capture types. This should speed the system up quite a bit, though it may only be noticeable in large groups of rapid attacks.
o Big thanks to Draco for updating ALL the affliction triggers with the more intuitive function names! -Draco
o Added a premonition highlighting and echo. If you don't notice it while bashing now, not my fault! -Ged
o Thanks to Auston and Draco for converting most of the afflictions table to the new format! -Draco/Auston
o Fixed a rare bug that caused the prompt to display wrong if you logged on a vampire, then a non-vampire. -Ehlana
o Thanks to Draco again for reformatting the defenses table! -Draco

v5.1
o Fixed minor bugs in the magician and priest bashing functions. -Draco
o Fixed a bug in the diagnose funcion that made it clear all afflictions if you sent diag. -Vilnearo
o Fixed some bugs with resetting afflictions after focusing and having nothing to cure. -Caes
o Changed the idiocy affliction to 'stupidity'. It should now actually cure it!
o Added impale, grab, and earthbind attacks to the priorities table. It should now defend these!
o Fixed another bug with diagnose that sometimes made it not recognize any afflictions. -Elaisa
o Recreated the attack echoes for soldiers and rogues, and expanded them to include some missing from earlier versions. As a result, dual-wield should now work properly!
o Similarly, added aliases for the new soldier attacks.
o Fixed a bug with afflictions not resetting after failed commands.
o Fixed a major bug with timewarp that caused it to stop healing compeltely in certain circumstances. -Elaisa
o Fixed a bug with the deffing up functions, it should be less spammy now.
o Fixed some bugs with sleep, timewarp, and lust tracking.
o Added the diag for stacks of infirm. -Sutao

v5.2
o Fixed a small typo that made attack queuing hell for dual-wielding soldiers. Oopsie.
o Fixed the bug that sometimes caused the system to loop defenses when reading scrolls, seeing illusions, or when attacks don't complete. -Auston
o Fixed a bug with tracking entanglement, it should be much smoother and more accurate now.
o Fixed a small typo that was creating most of the bugs with timewarp.
o Finally worked out how to reset afflictions on stupidity, paralysis, chill, amnesia ticks without sending a lot of uncessary commands. The system should now handle these much much better, especially in timewarp.
o Added a passive recklessness check. It's currently limited and only works in PvP, but is easily expanable and will be working on it.
o Fixed a major bug that sometimes made the system spam you to hell on blacken hitting, to the point you had to close mudlet. -Caes, Firengaud
o Tweaked the set_attack function so that queuing an attack no longer overwrites curing commands in timewarp. This should clean up timewarp performance a LOT.
o Added a 'looping' toggle. While active, the system will keep queuing your last attack instead of clearing it after sending. The no target lines clear your attack, to prevent spamming. -Stye
o Tweaked the magician bashing function some more. You can now toggle the use of ice spikes and eldritch barrage with tis and tbrg respectively. -Firengaud
o Adjusted the healing priority a bit. I still haven't spent a lot of time with it, but I moved some of the big things around. Like blackout. It should be noticeably better, just not perfect yet.
o Fixed melt and puncture, the system should now recognize them as stripping defenses, and reapply those defenses if you have them toggled 'on'.
o Fixed a major bug with tracking missed attacks. These should now be recognized and no longer cause loops or confusion. -Draco
p Fixed a less major bug with tracking defended attacks. It should now properly show what defense you used when you do so.
o Removed batter as an attack and battered as an affliction.
o You can now toggle atkecho and defecho to toggle on and off the colored echoes on incoming and outgoing attacks respectively with the tdef and tatk aliases.
o Added some of the magician attack echoes. -Firengaud
o Added an attack alias to queue touch serpent. Damn you Sappho!
o Updated the full inferno alias to change the order of the effects and add some missing ones. -Sappho

v5.3
o ACUTALLY fixed the major bug that sometimes made the system spam you to hell on blacken hitting, to the point you had to close mudlet. For real this time! -Caes, Auston
o Fixed a bug that sometimes caused rogue prompts to disappear after sending IH. -Orsyn, Shlean
o Fixed a bug that caused the bashing for rogues to only hit once per target. -Erwing
o Updated the FAQ again with some details on how you can help me track and fix bugs you find.
o Started rewriting all the incoming attack lines to prevent hit and defend ones from both firing at once. -temporaneous
o Set the cure for impatience to spirit instead of mind. Whoops.
o Got a list of all the missing triggers from Vanko, and started working on collecting them up. -Vanko
o Fixed some typos in, and messed about more with the order of, the priority table.
o The soldier bashing function will no longer use offhand balance if the mob target is very low health. Because wasting offhand balance sucks.
o You should no longer keep trying to put coins in a pack or container when you don't have balance. -Vanko

v5.3.1
o Added a pumpkin bashing module.
o Added offhand balance echo.

v6.0

o Prompt exp now goes to the nearest hundredth (thanks Akaxi!)
o Update brought to you by Orsyn :D

v6.1
o Optimized the use of inquartata for rogue bashing. -Olbiad
o Magicians who queue FLEE now will have spellshield toggled off when doing so. This should prevent situations where you queue flee, spellshield breaks, and it keeps looping putting spellshield back up because it keeps breaking and never actually flees. HOWEVER, this also means you need to remember to load your defense options again after fleeing. -Orsyn
o Checked and fixed all the thanatology attacks. The system should now perform infinitely better against them. -Stye
o Took a good look at divine command, you should now properly reject/focus with it. -Stye
o Added an attack reset timer. Attacks that don't land after five seconds will now be 'reset' and assumed to have failed.
o Added shadow weaving aliases. -Thaeae
o Added an 'h' to the prompt for rogues who are hidden, similar to spellshield's @ indicator.
o The rogue bashing function will no longer fleche if the target is very low health, and now tracks when a mob target stops bleeding to re-fleche.
o Bards can now use canto while bashing, by setting can.canto and toggles.cantoing to true. The alias tcnt will toggle cantoing.
o Mounting will now properly remove the hiding defense.
o Fixed an odd bug with the gmcp_room script. Not really sure what it did, or what caused it, but it created an error message on the debug so I fixed it...

v6.2
o Added the new clotting system, incorporated it into the healing queue so it works in timewarp, and made a honest effort at preventing it from panicking when you are illusioned 583709238509847893 bleeding.
o Fixed some hemophilia misspellings (with two S!).
o Fixed some typos in attack lines that have been fixed in the game now!
o Learned some new tricks with lua that should make a lot of the functions in the system a bit faster now. -Jessamin
o Changed a lot of the regex triggers to exact matches ones, this should make things run tiny bit faster.
o Replaced more of the names and weapon descriptions in attack triggers with a more exact wildcard that should make tracking defending versus hitting or missing more accurate. Thanks to Fudkin for doing the rogue ones! -Fudkin
o Fixed a typo that made repulse not track defending attacks properly.
o Changed the riding r in the prompt to a mounted m, the new r tracks soldiers' roar balance. Let me know if this a big confusion issue for non soldiers and I can change it back! -Caes
o Changed the .zip system file to a .rar because winzip was being stupid. -Ged

v6.3
o Fixed a small error that made soldier roar balance only display for soldiers who can dual wield. Whoops.
o Moved the gmcp.Char.Status information out of the gmcp.Char.Vitals event handler, I think this was creating a rare bug where some of the values were undefined and the event would end before updating your health and other vitals. -Moonie
o Added sleight of hand as an attack you can defend. -Erwing
o Added sleight of hand and coup de grace as attacks with attack echoes for rogues. -Erwing
o Added Aislyn to the auto learn table of tutors. Let me know if there's any other tutors I missed! -Erwing
o Added the defenses combat focus, awareness, forboding, premonition, thirdeye, dragon, compass, owl, and skull as ones you can toggle to keep up. -Erwing
o Also added tenacity as a defense for soldiers, and added it to the soldiers default options.
o Fixed some more no-longer-typos that were still in the triggers.
o Extended the balance tracking functions to psi balance, you will now see the colored balance regain echoes and the time you spent off psi balance, just like other balances already worked. -Draco
o Added Draco's deathbeam alias. It's called deathbeam. -Draco
o Added a new bashing toggle, asp, which tells the system to stop bashing after the next kill or no target line. This should help a lot of the little people who need breaks between mobs. -Amethyst

v6.4
o Fixed the long standing shadowmending bug. Sorry it took so long to get around to! I could never find it because shadowmending was working fine for my thief character. -Erwing
o Added a hiding toggle. ALL this does is make the system automatically send hide after clearing a room while bashing. -Erwing
o Went through and changed all the send functions in the defense scripts to set_send instead, you should now effectively keep up defenses while slow curing (in timewarp or with divine censure).
o Fixed the bleeding toggle! Forgot to convert it when changing over to the clotting system. Sorry about that! It now works like before, you can toggle bleeding to set whether or not to clot. -Chapel
o Added faithful refuge as a defense you can toggle. I do NOT suggest using kd refuge, because it gets stripped with every hit. You can however add refuge = "once" to your custom defense options now for deffing up before a fight. -Medeia
o Modified the full inferno alias. -Vanon
o Fixed a bug that caused the system to not recognize some of the lines from when you successfully defend an attack. -Caes
o Added more defend/miss lines. There's still a bunch missing, if anyone notices any, copy down the line and send it to me!
o Fixed a misspelling of maladroitness in the priorities table that made it not heal that affliction. -Vanon
o Added lust to the priorities table. I'd left it out because I use lust for extra ALLIES list space, but added it back and just kept a copy of my own priorities list. Sorry Saithe! -Vanon
o Added a few more areas to the area list table for preset bashing targets. -Saithe, Jasha
o Fixed a typo with the diagnose line for sun allergy.
o Added the balance timer to the table for psi balance. You should now be able to queue psi attacks again sorry! -Rosalia
o Added afflines triggers for every affliction.
o Fixed a bug that sometimes caused immolate to loop and miss while magician bashing. -Nivek
o Converted more triggers from pearl regex to exact match, making things run just a little bit faster.
o Added waterbreathing as a defense for magicians to use kd for.
o Added the miss line for barrage to track the cooldown on it more accurately.
o Fixed a bug that causes the bashing to reset to the current area every time you moved when you were trying to go around bashing wyrms. You will now need to SURVEY to revert to your normal area.
o Updated the names of several afflictions to match the ones in the game. For instance, vomiting is now the more proper nausea.
o Added the give and diag lines for burnt tongue! System heals it now!
o Added secondary defending. That is, if someone tries to slash you and you have dystonia, you'll now try to block them instead of trying to parry anyway. If you have dystonia and cataplexy, you'll do nothing.
o I BELIEVE I made it so that only the afflines messages will return colored affliction echoes. If any other affliction lines are doing this, it's a bug so let me know.
o Fixed a bug with the naming of tears alias. It apparently only works with 'naming', not 'naming of tears'. -Saithe

v6.5
o Added the cure line for the Nighthawk silverthorn unconsciousness. It should no longer freeze the system until you reset. -Murkistad
o Fixed a bug with water breathing tracking. You should no longer endlessly loop casting it when using the kd toggle for it. -Althaea
o For some reason, there were two do_bashing() functions. Now there's only one. And it checks for stun and some other things. Yay.
o Added some more lines that end the rifting process, so the pause for rifting gets fixed more accurately now.
o Added an anti-theft feature to put coins in pack immediately after selling credits. -Althaea
o Fixed a typo in the priorities table for collapsed lungs. You should now heal it once again.
o Added an alias to queue touch shield tattoo.
o Re-did some of the magician aliases. Make sure to look them over if you use them!
o Fixed the water breathing DEF trigger to match the new line for it.
o Fixed a major bug that caused the system to ignore all single-word affliction give lines. Like tethed, warped, and paralyzed. Oopsie. -Iralah, Ethon
o Added all the missing magician first-person attack lines. Lots more pretty colors now!
o Made it so that you will no longer defend against the first attack that will land if you have the faithful refuge or mirror image defense active, since it will automatically miss.
o Fixed a bug with tracking and healing anemic, it should work properly now.
o Fixed a typo with exhausted affliction in the priorities list. You should heal it now!
o You should now defend in timewarp once again, adjusting times to account for the delay.
o Added the first person line for casting timewarp.
o The system should no longer loop defenses for any reason. It should at max try to send the defense for a single attack two times. This is because it now resets the attack if it hasn't landed five seconds after the telegraph. -Vanon
o The system now converts the periodic voting reminder messages into a clickable link to open the page to vote at. SO GO VOTE PEOPLE.
o Added a new alias, ?setup, that will send all the config options you need to properly set up the system when importing it for the first time. This should make it easier to jump right into it. -Savil
o Updated the FAQ with recent changes to how the system works.
o Split the old halp alias into three new ones, ?help, ?toggles, and ?bashing.
o Changed the old sts alias to a new ?stat alias.
o Added a ?info alias that displays some version info.
o Added four new thanatology defenses as ones you can toggle one. -Nicholo
**NOTE** Witchsight is the same defense given by the demonology witchsight skill and the thanatology spectral vision skill. The defenses table has lines for both, you must use -- to comment out the line that does NOT apply to your class.
o Slightly tweaked the priority list to heal some more important afflictions first. Will be giving this a more thorough going over in the near future.

v6.6
o Added the fade line for deathwhisper. -Nicholo
o Added requiem to the bard bashing function. -Fudkin
o Rewrote the overdrive function to lower the adrenaline check when spellshield is active, and to add the functionality of using ODM when health is fine and magic is low and spellshield is not active.
o Rewrote the reject function to account for mental afflictions preventing rejecting mindmeld.
o Rewrote the focus function to account for blood omen stopping ill omen, and mindmeld stopping tethered. Keep in mind that trying to focus away another affliction of the same type might still cause the failed message.
o Fixed some bugs with the auto counter attack function. It should now work again. -Vanon
o Added an auto counter attack toggle. You can now use tcoun to easily switch it on and off. It also won't try to counter or inq in timewarp.
o Toyed around a bit more with the priority queue.
o Added a handful of priest attack echoes. More to come!
o Adjusted the focus function even more to handle the mindmeld/tether/astral warp combo better. It works good now. Maybe not perfect, but well enough to heal out of three magicians trying to shut me down, so it should be decent.
o The gg alias will now properly gather all the coins, corpses, and area-specific items in the room.
o The tgg alias now properly toggles the automatic gathering of gold/items.
o The system now clears the corpses and gathering tables each time it sees that you sent IH--this means it should no longer occasionally spam trying to get an item several times in one gathering attempt.
o Added the line for STOP CLOTTING, using this should no longer disable bleed curing. Whoops.
o Made changes so that the system handles balance loss and equilibrium loss as afflictions, it should deal with these much more effectively now, especially in timewarp. -Ameroth
o Added shadowcall lash to the priest bashing function, along with a new toggle, tlsh. -Barakis
o Put some work into the fishing module, you now have a 'fastfish' option in the fishing table, and a new fcut alias that will queue fishing cut. -Firengaud
o Began tracking third party attack lines. The system will now gag and replace some of them, and store times from them.
o The system will now attempt to defend attacks made against people soldiers are shielding. Still limited, need to gather more lines.
**NOTE** Both of these changes only apply to hamstring at the moment. I'm adding more as quickly as possible, expect them to be functional next update.

v7.0
o Updated the FAQ to reflect some more recent changes. -Atayos
o Added a critical hit tracker thingy. It's cool!
o Made a small change to the auto-shadowmending while bashing, it should no longer occasionally mess up and leave shadowmending on.
o I -believe- I fixed the auto-re-hiding while bashing toggle. It should now actually works. Since it checks for balance now. Whoops. -Erwing
o Redid, uh, ALL the second person attack triggers. Like...all...of them...
o Modified the rift handling, it should no longer hang up if you misspell your rift, or use it off balance. -Giada
o The system now tracks poisons on rogue weapons when you WIPE, EVENOM, WEAPONPROBE, or hit with your attacks. -Erwing
o Added a toggle for rogues to display the affliction given by the next layer of poison on their main weapon to the prompt. -Erwing
o Added a toggle, ttime, for timestamps to display on the prompt, for easier logging purposes. -Nomi
o Dramatically improved tracking and healing of divine command.
o The system will now queue diagnose any time you have divine command and also have equilibrium, to try and prevent most commands from being possible.
o Added the trigger for when a fish snaps your line, you should no longer have to manually sort that out. -Nicholo
o Added a toggle that displays the afflictions given by your attacks after the attack echo. -Nomi
o Moved the attack queuing functions outside the toggles.healing check, you can now turn healing off and still attack.
o Reworked some of the first person attack lines. Not all yet. It's a work in progress!
o Added a very very obvious ~-+-~HEALING OFF~-+-~ display to the prompt when toggles.healing is false. -Azlee
o Made STORMFURY PROMPT display charges as blue on the prompt, instead of taking the purple color from cadence. -Azlee
o You now have aliases to create, hide, show, lock, unlock, move, resize, and set the font in five different windows, visable from the ?windows menu. However, none of them have anything in them yet. Coming soon! -Jessamin
o Added rage and liturgy triggers that will only fire when not bashing or fishing. -Loria
o Changed the enemy_health colors for spellshield to varying shades of blue/purple/pink instead of the normal green/yellow/red. -Ulalah
o Fixed some issues with requiem in the bashing for bards. It should now use it properly, and save it for mobs with over 25% health. -Nomi, Fudkin
**NOTE** This version has some missing first person defend lines due to the new first person handling I put in to allow the affliction echoes.
