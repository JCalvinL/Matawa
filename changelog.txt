o Fixed some errors in some priest defense lines.

With low magic and stormfury, it will use ice spikes if possible, and stormfury release if not. -Nivek, Firengaud, Ethon
o Fixed a bug with continuing to cast melting ice spikes, it should stop doing that now. -Nivek

o Fixed a bug with holy fire not working in the priest bashing function...hopefully? -Sappho
o Incorporated some of Savil's anti-theft updates, and some other nifty things inspired by it. Thanks! -Savil
 **NOTE** I did NOT include Savil's retaliate function because I feel this is pushing too close to making bashing a bit too automated. Feel free to cannibalize it from Savil's update, but I'm not going to add it to the public version.
o You now have a closing toggle, tcl, to toggle keeping your container closed or not.
o Added a marching toggle. If marching is on and you're a soldier, sending directions will now MARCH instead of just go.
o Added some more magician defenses. -Tethys, Savil
o Finally fixed that stupid shield rune bug. I changed the way the system tracks defending completely, it should now track times more accurately as well.
o Fixed a typo and missing line with sun allergy. -spiders
o Cleaned up and fine tuned soldier defending. A LOT. If you lose to me now it's your own fault and nothing else! Specifically, the system should track telegraph times against dual wielding much more accurately now, and shouldn't get confused about multiple shatters, as well as a few other fixes.
o Changed the can_ variables to a can table. This is so you can save them across updates in the future.
o The system now saves you settings across updates and sessions. The my, can, and toggles tables are saved every time you qq now and loaded from your hard drive on starting up the system's mudlet profile. I also moved them out to their own script, instead of sharing the variables one.
o Fixed the bug that caused the load times script to show bugged the first time you loaded the system on your computer. It now checks if you have the tables saved before trying to load them.
o Updated the halp alias to reflect the new changes and additions.
o Fixed a conflict with priest aliases. Firecall consumption and divine censure had the same name. Firecall consumption is now fcn instead of cns. -Arica
o Finally fixed the q alias. You can now manually load temporary target lists. For instance, in the Greenheart, using q boar deer rabbit and then turning hunting on and walking around will kill only the boars, deers, and rabbits, until you SURVEY or leave the area.
o The system will now display colored percentages for health and endurance when you ASSESS someone.
o The system will now display colored echoes of a target's afflictions when you ASSESS them, as well as echo some useful information based on what it sees. -spiders
o Added an automated nighthawk killer. -Orsyn
o Added a new toggle, you can now switch between percents and numbers in your prompt (for magic and health). -Orsyn
o Added some basic weapon tracking. If you have a weapon with a standard weapon type in the short_desc, the system will now set my.weapon to that weapon type when you're disarmed, etc. -Ignorance
 **NOTE** This won't work for things other than weapons, and obviously is a little bit sketchy. I might take another look at it later and clean it up some.

v3.4.1
o Finished changing the priest tert defend lines. Whoops.

v3.5
o Fixed a major bug that um...sort of disabled the entire system. Oopsie!
o The diag and assess function should now show burn levels instead of simple that the burns are there. -Sappho

v3.6
o Added blood to the prompt for vampires (hopefully).
o Fixed a bug with removing items. -Vanko
o Added bloodlore aliases. -spiders
o Set the stupid class tracking back to how I had it that worked. Grr.
o Added some warning echoes for instant kills that could land on you. Still limited, due to my laziness. -Vanko

v4.0
o Fixed a bug in the vampire blood tracking that was messing up the prompt for most people. -spiders
o Added anachronize as a magician defense, and added a toggle for it in the basher. -Vader
o Fixed the CFS trigger to work with the do_pack alias.
o The magician bashing function will now use ice spikes if you have stormfury up and low magic, instead of releasing stormfury or continuing to use high-cost stormlances. -Firengaud
o The system may or may not work in timewarp now. Honestly no idea. I imported and tweaked the setup I have working in Lusternia, and it works there, so it should work here in theory. I'm sure there will be lots of bugs, so test away.
o The system has a semi-mapper now. That is, it won't walk anywhere, but it does record information on every new room you enter, and store it on your computer. You can now use: area list, room find <string>, room list, room list <area>, and any numbers displayed in the lists you can use to PATH FIND to places. You will need to type msave after logging in the first time, then it should work bug free-ish...hopefully.
**NOTE** People who have another mapper, or don't want this feature, can disable the mapper folders in aliases, scripts, and triggers under the utility ones in each.
o I made toggles capitalize the first letter! Yay!
o Fixed a small bug with mutilate, and another with blacken. -Zona
o Toggling sundering on for soldiers should now work...but it's a waste of time, I'm telling you! -Akaxi
o Magicians can now toggle immolating on to immolate bashing targets with 25% health or less, if they are ignited. -Mardosi
**NOTE** People updating from previous versions may need to add immolate and anachronize to the can table, and immolating and anachronizing to the toggles table, since the system stores your settings on your computer and may not automatically add them.
o Updated the FAQ with some new common questions and instructions for some new features.
o Changed it so the vital stat changes on the prompt only show if they're not 0. Let me know if popular demand wants this changed back.

v4.1
o Fixed a bug in the set_send function that caused the system not to send anything, ever.
o Fixed a bug in the magician bashing that caused it to stop working completely under certain circumstances. -Firengaud
