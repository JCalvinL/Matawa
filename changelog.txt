o Fixed a typo with chill, it should track it better. -the Wraith
o Fixed some errors in some priest defense lines.

v3.3
o Fixed the lust rejection! It actually works now! -Shlean
o Fixed a small typo with the echo for when someone misses you. -Dysse

o Fixed the gathering toggle in the looting function, you can properly stop picking up coins now. -Firengaud
o Added some magician defenses. -Nivek, Firengaud
o Added stormfury checks to the magician bashing function. It will now use lance instead of spikes if you have stormfury up, even if the temperature is right, unless you have low magic. With low magic and stormfury, it will use ice spikes if possible, and stormfury release if not. -Nivek, Firengaud, Ethon
o Fixed a bug with continuing to cast melting ice spikes, it should stop doing that now. -Nivek
o Added a fleeing queue, it will now turn bashing and fasthunting off automatically when you FLEE, as well as send MAP the next time you change rooms after sending it. -Sutao

o Fixed a bug with holy fire not working in the priest bashing function...hopefully? -Sappho
o Incorporated some of Savil's anti-theft updates, and some other nifty things inspired by it. Thanks! -Savil
 **NOTE** I did NOT include Savil's retaliate function because I feel this is pushing too close to making bashing a bit too automated. Feel free to cannibalize it from Savil's update, but I'm not going to add it to the public version.
o You now have a closing toggle, tcl, to toggle keeping your container closed or not.
o Added a marching toggle. If marching is on and you're a soldier, sending directions will now MARCH instead of just go.
o Added some more magician defenses. -Tethys, Savil
o Finally fixed that stupid shield rune bug. I changed the way the system tracks defending completely, it should now track times more accurately as well.
o Fixed a typo and missing line with sun allergy. -spiders
o Cleaned up and fine tuned soldier defending. A LOT. If you lose to me now it's your own fault and nothing else! Specifically, the system should track telegraph times against dual wielding much more accurately now, and shouldn't get confused about multiple shatters, as well as a few other fixes.
o Changed the can_ variables to a can table. This is so you can save them across updates in the future.
o The system now saves you settings across updates and sessions. The my, can, and toggles tables are saved every time you qq now and loaded from your hard drive on starting up the system's mudlet profile. I also moved them out to their own script, instead of sharing the variables one.
o Fixed the bug that caused the load times script to show bugged the first time you loaded the system on your computer. It now checks if you have the tables saved before trying to load them.
o Updated the halp alias to reflect the new changes and additions.
o Fixed a conflict with priest aliases. Firecall consumption and divine censure had the same name. Firecall consumption is now fcn instead of cns. -Arica
o Finally fixed the q alias. You can now manually load temporary target lists. For instance, in the Greenheart, using q boar deer rabbit and then turning hunting on and walking around will kill only the boars, deers, and rabbits, until you SURVEY or leave the area.
o The system will now display colored percentages for health and endurance when you ASSESS someone.
o The system will now display colored echoes of a target's afflictions when you ASSESS them, as well as echo some useful information based on what it sees. -spiders
o Added an automated nighthawk killer. -Orsyn
o Added a new toggle, you can now switch between percents and numbers in your prompt (for magic and health). -Orsyn
o Added some basic weapon tracking. If you have a weapon with a standard weapon type in the short_desc, the system will now set my.weapon to that weapon type when you're disarmed, etc. -Ignorance
 **NOTE** This won't work for things other than weapons, and obviously is a little bit sketchy. I might take another look at it later and clean it up some.

v3.4.1
o Finished changing the priest tert defend lines. Whoops.

v3.5
o Fixed a major bug that um...sort of disabled the entire system. Oopsie!
o The diag and assess function should now show burn levels instead of simple that the burns are there. -Sappho

v3.6
o Added blood to the prompt for vampires (hopefully).
o Fixed a bug with removing items. -Vanko
o Added bloodlore aliases. -spiders
o Set the stupid class tracking back to how I had it that worked. Grr.
o Added some warning echoes for instant kills that could land on you. Still limited, due to my laziness. -Vanko

v4.0
o Fixed a bug in the vampire blood tracking that was messing up the prompt for most people. -spiders
o Added anachronize as a magician defense, and added a toggle for it in the basher. -Vader
o Fixed the CFS trigger to work with the do_pack alias.
o The magician bashing function will now use ice spikes if you have stormfury up and low magic, instead of releasing stormfury or continuing to use high-cost stormlances. -Firengaud
o The system may or may not work in timewarp now. Honestly no idea. I imported and tweaked the setup I have working in Lusternia, and it works there, so it should work here in theory. I'm sure there will be lots of bugs, so test away.
o The system has a semi-mapper now. That is, it won't walk anywhere, but it does record information on every new room you enter, and store it on your computer. You can now use: area list, room find <string>, room list, room list <area>, and any numbers displayed in the lists you can use to PATH FIND to places. You will need to type msave after logging in the first time, then it should work bug free-ish...hopefully.
**NOTE** People who have another mapper, or don't want this feature, can disable the mapper folders in aliases, scripts, and triggers under the utility ones in each.
o I made toggles capitalize the first letter! Yay!
o Fixed a small bug with mutilate, and another with blacken. -Zona
o Toggling sundering on for soldiers should now work...but it's a waste of time, I'm telling you! -Akaxi
o Magicians can now toggle immolating on to immolate bashing targets with 25% health or less, if they are ignited. -Mardosi
**NOTE** People updating from previous versions may need to add immolate and anachronize to the can table, and immolating and anachronizing to the toggles table, since the system stores your settings on your computer and may not automatically add them.
o Updated the FAQ with some new common questions and instructions for some new features.
o Changed it so the vital stat changes on the prompt only show if they're not 0. Let me know if popular demand wants this changed back.

v4.1
o Fixed a bug in the set_send function that caused the system not to send anything, ever.
o Fixed a bug in the magician bashing that caused it to stop working completely under certain circumstances. -Firengaud

v4.2
o Added the new soldier attacks and afflictions. -Sutao
o Made supernova give aurawarp.
o Sort of fixed the slowcuring bug. It's spammy since it still echoes what it's not sending, but it only actually sends one thing at a time now. Will fix this with next big update. -Firengaud
o If priest class tracking doesn't work now, I give up. So it better work.
o Added Firengaud's magician aliases. -Firenguad

v5.0
o Completely rewrote all the functions. ALL of them. The system has all the same features, but is now neater, cleaner, hopefully faster, and definitely easier to change and update. Sorry to people who were just puzzling out the script! At least it will be easier to learn new version.
o The system is now structured differently, broken into easier to modify modules separated by folders.
o With all the rewrites come new features, including a priority list which you can tweak to personalize the system. Almost all actions now fall in this queue, which dictates the order the system will try to do things. This is most important in slowcuring (timewarp/divine censure) Big thanks to Vanko for writing the default priority list.
o A side effect of this is that slowcuring is now much less spammy, though may not be quite perfect yet.
o Added balance timers. The system will now display the balance time, in seconds up to 1/1000, of each balance you regain. This also allows the system to reset balances that exceed their cap values.
o Tweaked some of the coloring to better suit the new layout of the system. The colors now relate to the different modules.
o You can now toggle fullprompt on and off, doing so will switch between the old method of display a 0 for vitals changes and the new method of only displaying if there is a non-0 change. -Auston
o Read through and updated the FAQ with all the new stuff and new paths to things, as well as adding explanations for some new features and recent bugs people have asked about. -Ged
o Made the auto turnin function easier to find and modify.
o Changed a lot of triggers to faster capture types. This should speed the system up quite a bit, though it may only be noticeable in large groups of rapid attacks.
o Big thanks to Draco for updating ALL the affliction triggers with the more intuitive function names! -Draco
o Added a premonition highlighting and echo. If you don't notice it while bashing now, not my fault! -Ged
o Thanks to Auston and Draco for converting most of the afflictions table to the new format! -Draco/Auston
o Fixed a rare bug that caused the prompt to display wrong if you logged on a vampire, then a non-vampire. -Ehlana
o Thanks to Draco again for reformatting the defenses table! -Draco

v5.1
o Fixed minor bugs in the magician and priest bashing functions. -Draco
o Fixed a bug in the diagnose funcion that made it clear all afflictions if you sent diag. -Vilnearo
o Fixed some bugs with resetting afflictions after focusing and having nothing to cure. -Caes
o Changed the idiocy affliction to 'stupidity'. It should now actually cure it!
o Added impale, grab, and earthbind attacks to the priorities table. It should now defend these!
o Fixed another bug with diagnose that sometimes made it not recognize any afflictions. -Elaisa
o Recreated the attack echoes for soldiers and rogues, and expanded them to include some missing from earlier versions. As a result, dual-wield should now work properly!
o Similarly, added aliases for the new soldier attacks.
o Fixed a bug with afflictions not resetting after failed commands.
o Fixed a major bug with timewarp that caused it to stop healing compeltely in certain circumstances. -Elaisa
o Fixed a bug with the deffing up functions, it should be less spammy now.
o Fixed some bugs with sleep, timewarp, and lust tracking.
o Added the diag for stacks of infirm. -Sutao

v5.2
o Fixed a small typo that made attack queuing hell for dual-wielding soldiers. Oopsie.
o Fixed the bug that sometimes caused the system to loop defenses when reading scrolls, seeing illusions, or when attacks don't complete. -Auston
o Fixed a bug with tracking entanglement, it should be much smoother and more accurate now.
o Fixed a small typo that was creating most of the bugs with timewarp.
o Finally worked out how to reset afflictions on stupidity, paralysis, chill, amnesia ticks without sending a lot of uncessary commands. The system should now handle these much much better, especially in timewarp.
o Added a passive recklessness check. It's currently limited and only works in PvP, but is easily expanable and will be working on it.
o Fixed a major bug that sometimes made the system spam you to hell on blacken hitting, to the point you had to close mudlet. -Caes, Firengaud
o Tweaked the set_attack function so that queuing an attack no longer overwrites curing commands in timewarp. This should clean up timewarp performance a LOT.
o Added a 'looping' toggle. While active, the system will keep queuing your last attack instead of clearing it after sending. The no target lines clear your attack, to prevent spamming. -Stye
o Tweaked the magician bashing function some more. You can now toggle the use of ice spikes and eldritch barrage with tis and tbrg respectively. -Firengaud
o Adjusted the healing priority a bit. I still haven't spent a lot of time with it, but I moved some of the big things around. Like blackout. It should be noticeably better, just not perfect yet.
o Fixed melt and puncture, the system should now recognize them as stripping defenses, and reapply those defenses if you have them toggled 'on'.
o Fixed a major bug with tracking missed attacks. These should now be recognized and no longer cause loops or confusion. -Draco
p Fixed a less major bug with tracking defended attacks. It should now properly show what defense you used when you do so.
o Removed batter as an attack and battered as an affliction.
o You can now toggle atkecho and defecho to toggle on and off the colored echoes on incoming and outgoing attacks respectively with the tdef and tatk aliases.
o Added some of the magician attack echoes. -Firengaud
o Added an attack alias to queue touch serpent. Damn you Sappho!
o Updated the full inferno alias to change the order of the effects and add some missing ones. -Sappho

v5.3
o ACUTALLY fixed the major bug that sometimes made the system spam you to hell on blacken hitting, to the point you had to close mudlet. For real this time! -Caes, Auston
o Fixed a bug that sometimes caused rogue prompts to disappear after sending IH. -Orsyn, Shlean
o Fixed a bug that caused the bashing for rogues to only hit once per target. -Erwing
o Updated the FAQ again with some details on how you can help me track and fix bugs you find.
o Started rewriting all the incoming attack lines to prevent hit and defend ones from both firing at once. -temporaneous
o Set the cure for impatience to spirit instead of mind. Whoops.
o Got a list of all the missing triggers from Vanko, and started working on collecting them up. -Vanko
o Fixed some typos in, and messed about more with the order of, the priority table.
o The soldier bashing function will no longer use offhand balance if the mob target is very low health. Because wasting offhand balance sucks.
o You should no longer keep trying to put coins in a pack or container when you don't have balance. -Vanko
