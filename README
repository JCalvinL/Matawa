This git repository is an attempt to rework the Matawa system for Mudlet/MidkemiaOnline in a collaborative work.

Detailed instructions to use it can be found at http://forums.midkemiaonline.com/discussion/comment/27679/#Comment_27679 .

The idea behind is to keep a minimal amount of things to be coded in Mudlet editor (one liners for triggers/aliases, and really few scripts - the ones to load everything from lua files, and the ones needed to use GMCP).

Here are a few git cheatsheets :
